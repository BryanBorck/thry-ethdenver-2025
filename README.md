This project is an innovative app built around the Hedera Agentic Kit. It exposes a chat interface that allows users to interact with an intelligent agent capable of communicating with the Hedera chain. The agent interprets unstructured queries, enabling users to perform a variety of operations such as checking balances, executing transactions, creating tokens, and moreâ€”all through natural language commands.

## Project Overview

This application not only leverages the current capabilities of the Hedera Agentic Kit but also integrates a new wallet provider. This wallet provider extends functionality to Hedera users by allowing operations on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) using popular wallets like MetaMask. Moreover, the app offers secure signing of all critical operations with your wallet, eliminating the need to input your private key.

### Key Features

- **Chat Interface:** Communicate with an intelligent agent that interprets natural language queries to interact with the Hedera chain.
- **Hedera Operations:** Easily perform transactions, check balances, create tokens, and more.
- **Multi-Wallet Support:** Integrates a brand new wallet provider enabling Hedera users to operate on the EVM using wallets such as MetaMask.
- **Secure Signing:** Sign operations securely with your wallet, without the need to expose your private key.
- **Portfolio Management:** View and manage your digital assets with a built-in portfolio feature.
- **Audio Input:** Accept audio inputs to make interactions even more intuitive.
- **Persistent Memory:** Enjoy state persistence across different sessions, ensuring continuity in your operations.

## Hackathon Submission

This project was developed as a submission for a hackathon focused on Web3 and the Hedera chain. It showcases the practical utility of integrating new wallet providers and advanced agentic capabilities. By merging natural language processing with decentralized finance, the app demonstrates how users can interact with blockchain technology more intuitively and securely.

### Why It Matters

- **User-Friendly Experience:** Simplifies complex blockchain operations with an intuitive chat interface.
- **Enhanced Security:** Offers secure transaction signing without exposing private keys.
- **Innovation in Web3:** Represents a significant step forward in making blockchain technology accessible to a broader audience through innovative design and integration.
